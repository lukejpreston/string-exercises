# String Manipulations

Using Ruby the following is a series of string manipulations that you need to get working.

Things to consider
* You do not need to complete the exercises, we are looking to learn how you approach a problem
* You can use native functions in Ruby, but we are looking at how you would solve the algorithm
* You can start anywhere you like
* Feel free to add/change tests as you see fit
* Move on when you are confident you have all the coverage you need

## Running

```
gem install rspec
rspec exercise_spec.rb
```

or

```
bundle install
rspec exercise_spec.rb
```
